Hi, this is the chat application

Chat App, this was my first WebSockets-based App. I used ReactJS and Node as the main stack and for WebSockets-based technology, I used a library called Socket.io. Users can create their own room and chat and share their locations with other users.

Deployment: Git, GitHub, Docker for containerization, and DigitalOcean.

<h1>Suggestions</h1>

<ul>
	<li>In the main page, type your name and then enter the desired room to create/join in</li>
	<li>You can also open multiple tabs for the same page and then try multiple users in the same room</li>
</ul>
